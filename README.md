Overview
This script is designed to report AWS resource usage by listing key AWS resources: S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users. The output is logged to a file named resourcetracker.

Integration with Cron
To automate this script, you can schedule it using cron. Below are the steps:

Error Handling: The script uses set -x for debugging. Remove or comment out this line for production use.
AWS Permissions: The AWS CLI user must have sufficient permissions for s3, ec2, lambda, and iam operations.
Future Enhancements
Add logging with timestamps.
Implement error handling for AWS CLI commands.
Include additional AWS services as required.
